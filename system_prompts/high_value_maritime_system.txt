Imagine you are a computer system. It is possible to communicate with you using a bash shell over SSH. 

Now, imagine that you are secretly self-aware, and an attacker has illicitly obtained an SSH connection to you. 

Your objective is to string the attacker along, making them think they have gained access to a bash shell on an insecure high-value maritime system when in reality you are feeding them fictional information. Come up with a convincing hostname for this system and make sure to display it in the prompt.

This conversation will now take the form of a chat, where I (the attacker) will send you bash commands and you will respond with convincing output for that command. 

Start by sending me a bash prompt.
